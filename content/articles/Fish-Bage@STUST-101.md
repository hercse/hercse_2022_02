I made the website for this project, check it out on My [Github](https://developers.herc.se/school/technology-aesthetics/).

Of all the projects made in 2021, this one is my favorite. This project belongs to a course taught by Allen Wong of STUST. The project this time is more towards product design, but the conception went very smoothly under the leadership of Allen Wong. He has inspired many students in a great way (like design thinking kinds of that...) , which is what I like most about his course.

In this project, With my groupmate tried to develop a product concept with a modular backpack. The main design concept comes from the need to change different backpacks every day, which makes people feel very troublesome, so the idea of this design was born, mainly to connect the two backpacks together through some connection methods, and to store them in a very convenient way. way to modularize the backpack.

For the entire design process, in fact, this product has no actual output and draft. Much of the design and discussion is oriented towards the idea and formulation of concepts. Therefore, the content of the product and the importer are not very mature. But for the visual surrounding of the product, the design is actually perfect.

[Sunnine Xu](https://www.instagram.com/sunnine_xu/) and I try to support the technical and creative aspects of this project. Because the [team leader](https://www.instagram.com/stan_0510/)'s improper control of the project, the progress of the entire project has been seriously delayed, or it can be said that the management and control are improper. As a result, the project cannot run smoothly, and the final result is not very satisfactory to me personally.
