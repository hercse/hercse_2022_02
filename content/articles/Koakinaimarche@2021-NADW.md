This design project is the first time I have a face-to-face conversation with an international designer to discuss the production of works, and this theme is an assignment set by a designer from Japan in the course called "Children's Market" ", which means that it is a market led by children. The form is a bit like pretending to be a family wine, but this time there is more money in the transaction. I hope that through this activity and design, it will help local children understand the importance of money management. and legitimacy.

At first, I started with a simple graphic design, using the building blocks that children can easily understand as geometric shapes. Combining elements such as smiling faces, perforated money, and building blocks, tell the story that this event wants to tell those around you. Since I was still experimenting with the AAA soft contrast theme at the time, I used the simplest blue color scheme as the color scheme. With a little children's font design, the whole is more in line with the symbolic characteristics of the children's market.

Then I used this symbol as the key vision, and the symbol even looked a lot like the Chinese character for "Gold". more in line with the theme of the event. By coding the logo, it is easier for people to recognize it. Because the logo has been coded, I used this dynamic identification system to create a series of posters and identifications to make the entire event more recognizable among the crowd.

At the final, in fact, the teacher and other students did not seem to be very satisfied with this work. According to my speculation, it may be in line with the expectations of the homework. The part I made may be more of a branding part, but they only asked for a logo design, which may have miscalculated. But I am still optimistic about the integrity and integrity of the work.
