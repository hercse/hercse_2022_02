In 2022, TDRI hold an exhibition at TDM called Swiss Max, which has many works and book resources, I really like the typography and graphic style of Swiss design.Through this opportunity, studied all of the works and books in the exhibition, and compiled a large online resource, hoping to help more designers who like Swiss graphic design. These include many of the University's public research Documents that appear in the exhibition, Which also Yearbook (graduation-production) and Journals. Or the author's personal website or biographical profile in the book. These materials can help interested designers to better understand and study design styles through the works of these designers.
