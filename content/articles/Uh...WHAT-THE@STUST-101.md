"Uhh..WHAT THE?" (恩...阿災？), is a picture book design with the theme of the new era of the epidemic and the library. Combining the elements of hand-painted and recycled paper, I try to create a teen-themed picture book that can express complex emotions and visual painting concepts.

The main concept of the picture book is based on the red line. In this difficult era of the epidemic, many people can unite everyone through the hope that they have in common. And that is the purpose of this painting. I hope that today's teenagers know that the world is not as dark as many videos and news on the Internet say. As long as you can think in another direction or look in another direction, in fact, many things can be viewed from different angles.

In this picture book, the protagonist follows the red line to a very lonely creature, and the protagonist is also very lonely, so the two characters begin to understand each other. The most distinctive point of this picture book is its title. If you look at the title, you can't actually tell what the plot wants to express, but it is very fascinating and can drive the curiosity of young students into what this picture book wants to express. world. Therefore, I hope that through this visual picture book design, combined with the communication elements of the library, students can know many attitudes towards different things.

The design of this picture book is actually a very novel one for me, because I have not tried a similar creative medium before, and it is the first time for me to experience the part of printing and publishing. Therefore, I am very much looking forward to having more opportunities to try to design and express a visual thing in various ways in the future. Hopefully there will be more unique opportunities to come.
