In this era of raging epidemic, many people think that this epidemic is a catastrophe of the century. Therefore, the fashion poetry design with the theme of the new hope of the epidemic was born. In this project, we tried to use the common plants in nature as our design theme, and tried to use the vibrant appearance of nature to present visual hope. imagery. Most plants need the warmth of the sun to grow in this world. At this time, we need the warmth of the sun just like plants. In this concept, I hope that we can make everyone feel the reality through the hope of visualization. The world needs warmth.\

The texture this time uses arrow bamboo, which can only be seen in difficult environments and high mountains, as the design unit, and I named this texture "mangostan", which means bamboo in the mountains. Bamboo can grow rapidly in many environments, especially in such a difficult environment, it can also grow into a large piece.

Among them, the main theme color also adopts the soft color matching of AAA contrast. The main standard color is dark army green, which is printed with the cold of the mountains and the green of the bamboo itself. After unfolding this design unit, you can see many patterns like the main order. Putting this textured design on various products, whether it is fabrics or bags, it looks like it is shuttled among these arrow bamboos.

In the end, I think the project designed this time is actually not too big. Because the material and the scope of play become quite limited, it limits the final development of the work. I think it's a bit of a shame, but it's a successful weave design anyway.
