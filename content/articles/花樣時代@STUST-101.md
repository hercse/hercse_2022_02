This project is a discussion work of the first grade course, which is guided by the teacher [Hsu Hung-Pin](https://www.instagram.com/hsuhungpin/), who leads and guides students to further understand what brand design is and how to contact with subjects, And which get to know about what the "branding" in the industry are looks like.

The Outdated Flower Pattern (花樣時代) is the theme chosen by the my team group. The theme is foucs on HUA-BU(花布), which is Taiwan's traditional patterned fabric, we tried to break through the original colorful visual image of the patterned fabric, because I think it looks chaotic. We trying to, without losing the original visual and meaning, redefines the appearance of HUA-BU , examine and deeply dig what HUA-BU is.

First of all I used typographic as the basis of the design and combined with traditional serif fonts to make the picture look more retro. Like an Art Nouveau poster, I tried to recreate that feeling. Among the fonts we used, Magilio caught our eye with its smooth lines, because the ends of its strokes looked like petals, so we made this font for our key vision title font.

I am the main of the key vision planning in this project, of course the briefing and part of the dynamic design is also in charge of me. After the group discussion, the logos of dynamic recognition and static recognition finally used my design.The reason why I chose red as the theme color at first is because most people's impression of HUA-BO is red, so I have established the key vision color based on AAA soft contrast color.

I can say that this project was not very successful, and I am not a team leader myself, so many things are out of my control. (Although I am not responsible for it), for this very good course, I think it is a pity that this valuable learning opportunity was wasted. Hope to find better team members in the future to succeed this type of project.
