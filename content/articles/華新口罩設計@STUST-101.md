The first design is call "The red thread holding"(攜手紅線). Because the current epidemic is raging all over the world, I hope to connect the world through the red line of tight music all of them. And the illustrations on the masks represent everyone's intentions, like emblems of us. In the red thread that is surrounded, holding the red thread hand in hand to unite in this difficult time.

The Second is call "Stranded of forest"(森林之困). After watching a Netfilx movie called Don't Look Up, I decided to name the theme "Stranded of forest". The current society is too focused on the media and gossip that should not be focused, so I want to echo the issues that need to be paid attention to now around us through the image of the forest. Through the staggered and complex triangular structure, it symbolizes the lush greenery of the natural forest, and the tight structure creates a sense of pressure. He also drew sharp teeth that seemed to come from nature. What if nature was dying and they were facing us, coming at us, and we were still concerned about the scandals of politicians.
